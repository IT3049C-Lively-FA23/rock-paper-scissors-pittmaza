## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 20 does your team deserve on this assignment. Revise the assignment grading guideline and assignment rubrics for guidance. Although I did turn it in late, I did want to make a really conscious effort to try and get this working. Although I'd like to say 20/20, I'll have to give myself 17/20 to keep up with the syllabus rules. 

## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?
I really struggled with getting the play() function to work. To address this, I went to town using the debugger function. Debugging through chrome's developer tools made fixing these issues much easier to accomplish - Node.js debugging tools caused a major issue on my machine so having the ability to use this function really helped. 


### How long it took us to finish this?
4-5 Hours, had a bit of an issue with getting the switch statement to work.
